The source of this one was the frustration. I bought an `Asus ROG Ally` recently and I've been overall happy with the thing. Obviously there are things I dislike and I wish were better and the post is just about one of those.<br>

When playing on a handheld like that which runs on a battery it's very important to conserve energy when you're not actually playing. This includes correctly suspending the game if display goes off. This might be not really suitable for online games but for the single player ones there should be no excuses. Display goes off => Full stop.<br>

And guess what? It doesn't work like that. Some games seem to work correctly. Some work most of the time (like 80-90% of the time) and some just go full 50/50. Total freedom of choice. The game that drove me mildly nuts was `Ghostrunner`. It's a good game and I like playing it on a small device tucked in the bed. Nice. But I just don't get why do I have sometimes to press power button again and again just to get the thing to finally suspend. It. Is. Frustrating.<br>

Obviously debugging these things is a rabbit hole with no end in sight and I don't think I have time or motivation to investigate whether this is a game issue or an OS issue or whatever other issue there might be. Before I bought the `Ally` I did some research on what things people see as useful and in one blog suspending games was one of the points. It mentioned [Nyrna](https://github.com/Merrit/nyrna) as a possible solution and while it is good (or probably is, I don't know honestly. Check it out, it works on Linux too!) I just happened to remeber that there was a set of great tools for windows called [PSTools](https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/sysinternals/downloads/pstools) from `SysInternals` / `Mark Russinovich`. Simple honest CLI apps that been there for ages. This tool set includes `pssuspend` app which is just the right tool for the job.<br>

    *Small disclaimer*: I've talked to people about this and there seems to be a general concensus on the topic: it is hard to get right because every game is different and there might be games that just don't stop or crash either right away or after some time. So I'm not trying to tell you it is `THE SOLUTION`. I simply haven't tested every game in the world to be that sure.

Now what is left is to use the tool on right processes when display goes off and on. For this we will have to dive into `PInvokes` and `window_proc` stuff. I said "dive" but in fact there wasn't a dive really. Maybe just a slight surface touch. Just like checking what temperature sea water has.<br>

Pinvokes still have to be called though. I didn't want to type this stuff manually yet again (honestly writing Interop layer is quite boring) so a little bit of searching got me to [CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32) interop source generator. All it required is referencing a nuget and creating a `NativeMethods.txt` file that described what kind of apis I want to use. My version looked like this (I went quite lazy with User32 as you can see):

```
User32.*
PBT_*
DBT_*
WM_*
GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE
POWERBROADCAST_SETTING
```

Few keystrokes and full Windows interop is ready to work. Neat.<br>

By the time I wrote this it didn't really work on `.Net 8` because of recent `ref readonly` additions and that's a shame because `Native AOT` in `.Net 8` is really great. The prototype app I produced before (which did not solve my problem) w/o those PInvokes was about 3.3mb without any additional tinkering. For `.Net 7` though I sticked with standard Jit version.<br>


Now the thing itself is actually this:
```csharp
delegate void OnDisplayStatusChanged(object sender, OnDisplayStatusChangedArgs args);
record OnDisplayStatusChangedArgs(DisplayStatus DisplayStatus);

static unsafe class DisplayStatusListener
{
    public static event OnDisplayStatusChanged? OnDisplayStatusChanged;
    private static readonly object Sender = new ();

    private static LRESULT WindowProc(HWND hwnd, uint msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
    {
        if (msg == PInvoke.WM_POWERBROADCAST && wParam == PInvoke.PBT_POWERSETTINGCHANGE)
        {
            var setting = *(POWERBROADCAST_SETTING*) lParam.Value;
            if (setting.PowerSetting == PInvoke.GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE)
            {
                var value = setting.Data[0];
                OnDisplayStatusChanged?.Invoke(Sender, new((DisplayStatus)value));
            }

            return new(0);
        }

        return PInvoke.DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);
    }

    public static void RunWindowLoop()
    {
        fixed (char* wndClass = "GameWatcherWindowClass\0")
        {
            var wc = new WNDCLASSEXW
            {
                cbSize = (uint)Unsafe.SizeOf<WNDCLASSEXW>(),
                lpfnWndProc = WindowProc,
                lpszClassName = new(wndClass)
            };

            PInvoke.RegisterClassEx(wc);

            var hwnd = PInvoke.CreateWindowEx(
                default,
                "GameWatcherWindowClass",
                "GameWatcherWindow",
                WINDOW_STYLE.WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
                int.MinValue,
                int.MinValue,
                int.MinValue,
                int.MinValue,
                default,
                default,
                default,
                default
            );

            var guid = PInvoke.GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE;
            PInvoke.ShowWindow(hwnd, SHOW_WINDOW_CMD.SW_HIDE);
            PInvoke.RegisterPowerSettingNotification(new(hwnd.Value), &guid, (uint)REGISTER_NOTIFICATION_FLAGS.DEVICE_NOTIFY_WINDOW_HANDLE);

            while (PInvoke.GetMessage(out var msg, hwnd, 0, 0))
            {
                PInvoke.TranslateMessage(msg);
                PInvoke.DispatchMessage(msg);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

So much googling. So little code. The important part here is not to forget `RegisterPowerSettingNotification` call. This one enables our `WindowProc` to receive Display on / off notifications which we actually need.<br>


Process suspend/resume stuff is really easy too. Basically:
```csharp
static class ProcessExtensions
{
    private static Task ChangeProcessState(Process process, bool resume)
    {
        var resumeTag = resume ? " -r" : "";
        var procStartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("pssuspend64")
        {
            Arguments = $"{process.Id}{resumeTag} -nobanner"
        };
        return Process.Start(procStartInfo)!.WaitForExitAsync();
    }

    public static Task Suspend(this Process process) => ChangeProcessState(process, false);
    public static Task Resume(this Process process) => ChangeProcessState(process, true);
}
```

Run the process and wait a little.<br>

Now what is left is to 1) find the process to suspend or resume 2) wire up thing together.<br>

To solve 1) I went with the simplest possible approach: just a file containing `*.exe` paths of games I wish to suspend/resume. An automatic solution would be nicer but at the same time I don't have that many games anyway. Maybe in the future. Again, the code is very simple (note that current implementation assumes only one active game process):

```csharp
class GameLibrary
{
    private readonly HashSet<string> _processPaths = new();
    private int _currentGameProcessId = -1;

    bool IsGameProcess(Process process)
    {
        try
        {
            return _processPaths.Contains(process.MainModule!.FileName);
        }
        catch
        {
            return false;
        }
    }

    Process? GetGameProcessById(int id)
    {
        if (ProcessUtils.TryGetProcessById(id) is {} process
            && IsGameProcess(process))
        {
            return process;
        }

        return null;
    }

    public void AddGame(string gamePath)
    {
        var fi = new FileInfo(gamePath);
        _processPaths.Add(fi.FullName);
    }

    public Process? GetGameProcess()
    {
        if (GetGameProcessById(_currentGameProcessId) is {} knownGameProcess)
        {
            return knownGameProcess;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Looking for game processes...");
        var processes = Process.GetProcesses();

        foreach (var process in processes)
        {
            if (IsGameProcess(process))
            {
                _currentGameProcessId = process.Id;
                return process;
            }
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

Now to wire all things up I went with a `Channel` approach. Just to have things sorted out. `Display event comes in` => `message is sent to the channel` => `process state is changed`. This way I can easily guarantee sequential processing. `Semaphore` can also be used I guess but I just felt like doing some channeling.<br>

Another thing is obviously listening for the display changed events and starting a new thread listening for events.<br>

```csharp

_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    var resume = true;

    await foreach (var _ in channel.Reader.ReadAllAsync())
    {
        if (library.GetGameProcess() is {} process)
        {
            if (resume)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Resuming {process.Id} {process.ProcessName}");
                await process.Resume();
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Suspending {process.Id} {process.ProcessName}");
                await process.Suspend();
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Unable to find active game process. Continuing without changes.");
        }

        resume = !resume;
    }
});

DisplayStatusListener.OnDisplayStatusChanged += async (_, eventArgs) =>
{
    switch (eventArgs.DisplayStatus)
    {
        case DisplayStatus.Off:
            Console.WriteLine("Display is off...");
            await channel.Writer.WriteAsync(0);
            break;

        case DisplayStatus.On:
            Console.WriteLine("Display is on...");
            await channel.Writer.WriteAsync(0);
            break;
    }
};

_ = Task.Factory.StartNew(DisplayStatusListener.RunWindowLoop, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
```

I omitted some code that loaded game paths but I'm sure reading lines from file is not all that interesting anyway.<br>

So that's it. At least now I have some titles like `Ghostrunner`, `Disco Elysium` and `Stephen's Sausage Roll` (I personally recommend this one. It is fun. And from my observations it suspended correctly even without `pssuspend`'s humble request). I look forward to see what games can break. P.S. admin mode<br>
