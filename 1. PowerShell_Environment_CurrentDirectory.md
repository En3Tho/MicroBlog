Recently I've (like many others before me) hit a weird thing in my Powershell cmdlet.<br>
It's called [PoshDotnetDumpAnalyzerViewer](https://github.com/En3Tho/PoshDotnetDumpAnalyzeViewer) and like the name suggests, it's a viewer for a dotnet-dump for Powershell environment<br>
  
The weird thing was the pathing. No matter what my cmdlet couldn't resolve a relative path using the usual Path api. And when I called dotnet-dump directly everything worked like a charm.<br>

A little bit of searching got me to these issues:<br>
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/19446<br>
https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3428<br>
And there are many more actually...<br>

And the reason is quite simple: it seems like Powershell is maintaining the current directory as `ProcessWorkingDirectory` (or `$pwd`) sort of virtually.<br>
What I mean is it works in cmdlets like `Resolve-Path`, it is correctly applied when starting processes.<br>
But when it comes to .Net apis things do not work as expected because WorkingDirectory is set to the path where your Powershell instance was started.<br>

There are multiple simple fixes for this kind of problem if your cmdlet inherits from `PSCmdlet` (this is important because `Cmdlet` doesn't have a `SessionState` property):<br>

```csharp
[Cmdlet(VerbsCommon.Get, "MyCmdlet")]
public class MyCmdlet : PSCmdlet
{
    ...
    protected override void ProcessRecord()
    {
        var resolvedPath = SessionState.Path.GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath(relativePath);
        ... use resolved path directly ...
    }
}
```
or
```csharp
[Cmdlet(VerbsCommon.Get, "MyCmdlet")]
public class MyCmdlet : PSCmdlet
{
    ...
    protected override void ProcessRecord()
    {
        Environment.CurrentDirectory = SessionState.Path.CurrentLocation.Path;        
        ... now use any .Net path apis for relative paths with ease ...
    }
}
```

The first one is okay if you're not using `CurrentDirectory` anywhere. Like resolving paths or starting processes. You don't usually care for this stuff as it *just works*<br>
The second one is good if you do but it will persist `CurrentDirectory` globally as Powershell is well... just a .Net application after all.<br>

I decided to go with a modified approach where I restore `CurrentDirectory` just in case. Like this:

```csharp
public sealed record CurrentDirectoryScope(string Path) : IDisposable
{
    private static string SwitchCurrentDirectory(string path)
    {        
        var currentPath = Environment.CurrentDirectory;
        Environment.CurrentDirectory = path;
        return currentPath;
    }

    private readonly string _pathToRestore = SwitchCurrentDirectory(Path);

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Environment.CurrentDirectory = _pathToRestore;
    }
}

[Cmdlet(VerbsCommon.Get, "MyCmdlet")]
public class MyCmdlet : PSCmdlet
{
    ...
    protected override void ProcessRecord()
    {
        using var _ = CurrentDirectoryScope(SessionState.Path.CurrentLocation.Path);           
        ... now use any .Net path apis for relative paths with ease ...
        ... and also don't think about other cmdlets and what CurrentPath they expect ...
    }
}
```

I would really like to have F#-like static extension members so I could just extend `Environment` and call something along the lines of:
```csharp
[Cmdlet(VerbsCommon.Get, "MyCmdlet")]
public class MyCmdlet : PSCmdlet
{
    ...
    protected override void ProcessRecord()
    {
        using var _ = Environment.CreateCurrentDirectoryScope(SessionState.Path.CurrentLocation.Path);           
        ... now use any .Net path apis for relative paths with ease ...
        ... and also don't think about other cmdlets and what CurrentPath they expect ...
    }
}
```

It's a little extra verbose but it's neat that it's just right there with `CurrentDirectory` property.<br>
  
P.S. One more interesting way of solving this is to create an alias for `Set-Location` command and always update `CurrentDirectory` there.<br>
You end up with your personal `cd` only your profile knows though. And now it has a huge side-effect. But it's nice for things to happen automatically.
