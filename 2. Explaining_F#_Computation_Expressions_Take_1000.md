I really like to brag about Computation Expressions and how they are really cool and useful in lots of different contexts and applications. I have a few examples I can share:

Like yield-based code builder:
```fsharp
let generateWebApplicationExtensions() = code {
    "// auto-generated"
    "[<AutoOpen>]"
    "module En3Tho.FSharp.Extensions.AspNetCore.WebAppExtensions"
    ""
    "open System"
    "open Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder"
    ""
    "type WebApplication with"
    indent {
        for httpMethod in ["Get"; "Post"; "Put"; "Delete"; "Patch"] do
            for genericArgsCount in 1 .. 16 do
                generateCodeForHttpMethod httpMethod genericArgsCount
            ""
        trimEnd()
    }
}
```

Or a yield-based collection builder which can basically add a `collection initializer` to any type that has `void Add(T value)` method. This example is from `Gui.cs` terminal ui library`:
```fsharp
let setupViewsPosition (views: Views) =
    views.Top {
        views.Window {
            views.KeyQueryFrameView {
                views.KeyQueryTextField
            }
            views.KeyQueryFilterFrameView {
                views.KeyQueryFilterTextField
            }

            views.KeyQueryFilterTypeFrameView
            views.KeyQueryFilterTypeComboBox

            views.DbPickerFrameView
            views.DbPickerComboBox
            views.DbPickerCheckBox

            views.KeysFrameView {
                views.KeysListView
            }
            views.ResultsFrameView {
                views.ResultsListView
            }
            views.CommandFrameView {
                views.CommandTextField
            }
            views.ResultFilterFrameView {
                views.ResultFilterTextField
            }
        }
    }
```

Or populating Dictionary with values (similar to collection initializer above):
```fsharp
let initGlobalProperties (projectPath: string) (toolsPath: string) =
    Dictionary() {
        GlobalProperties.SolutionDir -- Path.GetDirectoryName(projectPath)
        GlobalProperties.MSBuildExtensionsPath -- toolsPath
        GlobalProperties.MSBuildSDKsPath -- Path.Combine(toolsPath, "Sdks")
        GlobalProperties.RoslynTargetsPath -- Path.Combine(toolsPath, "Roslyn")
        GlobalProperties.DesignTimeBuild -- "true"
        GlobalProperties.SkipCompilerExecution -- "true"
        GlobalProperties.ProvideCommandLineArgs -- "true"
        GlobalProperties.BuildProjectReferences -- "false"
        GlobalProperties.MSBuildEnableWorkloadResolver -- "false"
        GlobalProperties.RestorePackagesPath -- Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NUGET_PACKAGES")
    }
```

Obviously, tasks ... combined with a funky custom http requests that enable you to add headers after you describe the request itself:
```fsharp
[<Fact>]
let ``call task with ``() = task {
    ...        
    let! response = http.Post("https://my.url").Json(MyDto(10)).AsJson<MyDto>() {
        requestHeaders {
            "A" -- "B"
            "C" -- "D"
        }
        contentHeaders {
            "E" -- "F"
            "G" -- "H"
        }
    }
    ....        
}
```

Or even a Blazor builder! (with Tailwind coming in handly)
```fsharp
[<Route("FSharpPage"); Sealed>]
type FSharpPage() =
    inherit FSharpComponentBase()

    override this.BuildRenderTreeCore(builder) =
        builder {
            div { class' "h-full flex flex-col gap-1" } {
                h1 { class' "text-center text-xl text-red-500" } {
                    "Hello from F#!"
                }
                div { class' "flex-1 flex bg-blue-500 my-2 place-content-center" } {
                    span { class' "my-auto" } {
                        "Middle!"
                    }
                }
                div { class' "mt-auto text-blue-500 text-center" } {
                    "Div at the bottom?"
                }
            }
        }
```

The fun thing is that it's a very generic and versatile mechanism but when I send interested in this people to the [F# Computation expressions doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions) they are usually like: "Okay." (sending me a screenshot of that table under **Creating a New Type of Computation Expression**). And I understand them. Specially if you're coming from C# where it's usual to have quite verbose descriptive names, not like `m -> t` or similar.<br>

I think everything before this table is quite easy to understand. A general syntax. List of keywords and their explanations. I will try to explain this table I mentioned above a little bit better. Sorry if I fail. And also I will use C#-like syntax.<br>

To define out first silly little computation expression we will need to cover 2 methods: `Bind` and `Return`:<br>

1. Let's start with `Bind`.<br>
First, let's convert it's signature from the table to use "map" `M<'T> * ('T -> M<'U>) -> M<'U>` because I personally feel like this one is<br>
1) confusing<br>
2) assumes you have to have some kind of `Container<TValue>` or `Monad<TValue>` or `Computation<TValue>` (whatever) which is generally not true in my opinion. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.<br>

`TNext Bind(TValue valueToBind, Func<TValue, TResult> binder)` might seem much easier to understand now because it's really what it is. You take 2 parameters: `a value being bound` and a function that represents the `rest of computation expression` and you return something that will be returned by computation expression or combined with results of other bind calls. You can think of it as "Okay, I have this value I want to bind, I have some special logic I want to process this value inside my `Bind` method and I have the rest of the computation that will operate on that processing result".<br>

Now what if we need a specific version of `Bind` that receives values of specific type? No problem, let's just declare an overload!<br>
`TNext Bind(int value, Func<string, TNext> binder)` - this one will expect a int value being bound and a rest of expression that in fact expects string and not int to run further. This means we can convert our bound int value to string and call binder on it and be done!<br>
As you see, no monad mentioned anywhere, simple strings, ints and some return type we don't really care about.

2. Now to make out very silly computation expression complete, let's continue with `Return`<br>
`Return` is used to ... well, return something from your computation expression. In fact, return is just another method on the computation expression so honestly you can do whatever you want.<br>

The signature in the table is `'T -> M<'T>` and again, you don't have to think about this `M` because again you can return anything. It's just `TResult Return(TValueToReturn value)`. That's it. Why `M<T>` is mentioned there? It's because usually `return` keyword is used to wrap the value being returned into some type that computation expression returns. For example `task` computation expression will wrap `return "mystring"` into Task<string>. But this is not strictly necessary. This is all up to ce's implementor.<br>

Now that we have our 2 basic method let's do implement our very first silly computation expression<br>

```fsharp
// define the type that has methods we need, it's instance will be used to call those
type Silly() = 
    // Bind looks familiar isn't it?
    member _.Bind(value: int, code: string -> 'TResult) =
        code (value.ToString())
        
    // return is defined as "just return the value you got so the `return` keyword can be unlocked"
    // but only return strings.
    member _.Return(value: string) = value
    
let silly = Silly()

let callSilly = silly {
    let! xStr = x
    return xStr
}

test 1
```

Can you guess the result of `callSilly` function?<br>

You can have fun by changing the existing or adding more of `Bind` or `Return` overloads to unlock new possibilities of your computation expression. For example, you can add `Bind` overload that receives floats and turns them into strings, or you can change `Return`'s signature to return a generic type to enable your CE to just return whatever you want. You might want to use multiple binds though, both int and float versions.<br>

What else can we do? Let's print out some information conditionally like that
```fsharp
if xStr.Length > 0 then
    printfn $"{xStr}"
```

Compiler will complain that we're missing a `Zero` member. Let's check it out.

3. `Zero` member is a special one because it basically represents an action that will be called when you want to do *nothing* (as in `void` or `unit`).

3. In my opinion `Combine` is like a great mastermind of your computation expression. It knows how to link things and make them run together. Knows how to prevent invalid operations. Knows how to make your CE flexible and correct. It is more complex though and involves some functional thinking<br>
Let's look at the signatures from the table. We've got 2 of them: `M<'T> * Delayed<'T> -> M<'T>` and `M<unit> * M<'T> -> M<'T>`. Looks scary as always, especially the first one. But second one... let's try to look at it from multiple binds perspective of our SillyCE:
`TResult Combine(Func<TResultOfPreviousBind, void> firstPartOfExpression, Func<TResultOf)`
