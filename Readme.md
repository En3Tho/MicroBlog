I've been feeling like sharing some of my thoughts and findings for quite a long time. Partly because I think I sometimes things I do can help others. Party because I've been on full remote for far too long and I feel like this might be a good idea to communicate with the world a little bit more.<br>

So, here it is:<br>

1. [Setting up `Environment.CurrentDirectory` in Powershell Cmdlets](https://github.com/En3Tho/MicroBlog/blob/main/1.%20PowerShell_Environment_CurrentDirectory.md)<br>
*- Just another of these small things you're not prepared for.*

<br>

Possible future topics:
1. [Why I love `F# Computation Expressions`.]()<br>
*- CE's for collections, code generation, `Blazor` and more*

2. [`.Net` -> `Rust`. Why I think .Net is a really good starting option.]()<br>
*- `Borrow Checker` is **really** cool. But so is `Garbage Collector`. Pick a right one for your needs.*

3. [Thinking on it...]()<br>
*- Something here*
